## Overview  
This project simulates a **self-driving car using pure JavaScript (no libraries)**. It implements **AI-based decision-making** to navigate roads and obstacles.  

---
## **How to Use**  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone <repourl>
   cd self-driving-car-js
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**.  
3. **Adjust settings** (e.g., number of cars, mutation rate).  
4. **Observe the car driving autonomously!** üöó

## Project Overview
This innovative real estate price prediction app leverages React.js for the frontend and Brain.js for implementing a neural network model to predict property prices. Developed by Jyothi Prasanna Kambam, the app analyzes features like area, number of bedrooms, and location to provide accurate price estimates.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes Brain.js for advanced property price forecasting.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React.js for a smooth, responsive experience.
- **Data Visualization**: Incorporates Chart.js for clear, interactive data representation.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Enables users to see the impact of changes in input parameters on predicted prices
- **Easy Navigation**: Simple, intuitive interface for users to input data and view results.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to adjust input parameters and see the effect on predicted prices.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Brain.js**: For implementing the neural network model.
- **Chart.js**: For data visualization.
- **JavaScript**: For scripting and functionality.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the app.
- **Node.js**: For server-side functionality.

## How to Navigate
- Use the `src/` directory to find the main application code.
- The `components/` folder contains reusable UI components.
- The `ml-model/` folder contains the logic for the neural network model.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd path/to/yout/project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
